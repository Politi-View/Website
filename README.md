# Welcome!

Politi-View is a news-source-like website showcasing various views on political and cultural standpoints. Contrary to other outlets, we are not journalists, we are reporters. Every morning, Politi-View reporters scour major news outlets to compile five of the largest stories from up to four differing views.

### Our plans and goals:
Politi-View, in its current site, is an informational site. We work alone and early at insane hours in the morning. Eventually, we aim to hire writers and researchers to dilute the intensity of the project for everybody.

### A Simple Request:
This site is in very early stages and is far from complete. We kindly request, while all our code are open source, we kindly request that you notify us or request before using our code.

Thanks,

_Politi-View Team_
