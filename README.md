# Welcome!
This is a website that we have been working on, that essentially is a news source, but shows different sides, like political and cultural standpoints.  We are not journalists, we are reporters.  Every morning we scower major news sites, and compile 5 top stories with up 4 different views.

### Our plans and goals:
This, in its current state, is just a basic website, with information on it.  Every morning we have to redo the code, and add stories and stuff, that, hopefully, is not the plan.  Later on, we will most likley write some Ruby on Rails and make it easy to publish stories.  We also will probalby higher some writers to do the writing for us, and some other people to source and read news stories and an un-godly hour in the morning.

### Why this is inportant for you:
Well, to be blunt, it really isnt.  You could use the code as your own website, or just look in at what were doing.  Think we have a good idea?  Maybe you could support us, whatever you choose to do with this recource is fine by us.

### A Simple Request:
This site is in very early stages, this is not complete.  Please do not use our idea, or our code, and sell it as your own.  We think we are on to something, but we need your help by not spreading this as a finsihed product, or using our ideas/code as your own.  You can use our site for personal use, but please don't take our idea or anything.
